\section{Background}

%newline
The field of machine learning is witnessing a remarkable era of innovation in how we interact with and utilize language models. Research efforts are increasingly focused on instructing these models using retrieval augmentation and crafting intricate pipelines  that empower them to tackle intricate tasks \parencite{Lewis2020}. This proposal delves into the potential of DSPy, a framework renowned for its ability to compile declarative language model calls into self-improving pipelines \parencite{Khattab2023}. Our core focus lies on exploring DSPy's potential in the development of sophisticated, interactive language-based applications, with a particular emphasis on conversational AI agents.
\\

However, constructing intricate, interactive, language-based applications presents various challenges. Maintaining consistency and coherence throughout multi-turn conversations, accurately grasping user intent and context, and dynamically adapting responses based on new information and preferences are just a few hurdles to overcome \parencite{Vaswani2017}. Additionally, complex applications often demand multi-step reasoning and decision-making capabilities, which can pose significant challenges for current language models \parencite{Zha2023}. Integrating external knowledge sources further enriches interactions but introduces integration and information retrieval complexities.
\\

Previous research on utilizing language models for conversational AI agents has evolved through various stages. Early rule-based systems, while offering limited flexibility, laid the foundation for future advancements. Retrieval-based approaches improved fluency by retrieving relevant responses from vast datasets, but could not adapt to contextual nuances. Recently, generative models powered by neural networks, like LlaMA \parencite{llama2022} and GPT-4 \parencite{gpt4}, have ushered in a new era of more natural and flexible conversations. However, even these advanced models continue to grapple with biases present in their training data and struggle with interpretability due to their "black-box" nature \parencite{Mehrabi2019}. Additionally, the substantial computational cost associated with training and running large models remains a limiting factor.
\\

One downside of these impressive large generative language models lies in their dependence on carefully crafted prompts. While traditional handcrafting techniques have served us well, they come with limitations. Firstly, they can be time-consuming, requiring expert knowledge and effort to create effective prompts for specific tasks. Secondly, they're often subjective, reflecting the biases and knowledge of the individual crafter, potentially limiting the model's exposure to diverse perspectives. Additionally, handcrafted prompts can be inflexible, struggling to adapt to new information or situations, leading to potentially inaccurate or irrelevant outputs. Finally, they often lack scalability, making it difficult to efficiently generate prompts for large datasets or diverse applications. These limitations highlight the need for more automated and data-driven approaches to prompt generation, unlocking the full potential of these powerful language models.
\\

This is where DSPy steps in, offering a groundbreaking approach to overcoming these limitations and specifically addressing the issues surrounding traditional "prompting" techniques. Its core innovation lies in its ability to translate declarative language model calls into self-improving pipelines. By utilizing a Pythonic syntax, DSPy simplifies the definition of complex workflows, making it much easier for developers to construct intricate pipelines. Moreover, its composable modules, designed for specific tasks like reasoning and factual retrieval, provide a high degree of modularity and reusability.
\\

But DSPy goes beyond mere simplification. It boasts a unique self-improvement mechanism that leverages reinforcement learning and user feedback to continuously refine the responses generated by models within its pipelines. This continuous learning process allows conversational AI agents powered by DSPy to adapt and improve over time, fostering more engaging and personalized user experiences. Additionally, DSPy's ability to integrate seamlessly with retrieval models empowers these agents to tap into external knowledge sources, resulting in more informed and comprehensive responses.
\\

By delving into the potential of DSPy, this proposal aims to unlock new avenues for developing sophisticated and engaging conversational AI agents. By addressing the existing limitations of traditional methods and leveraging DSPy's unique functionalities, we hope to contribute to the ongoing advancements in this rapidly evolving field.

\section{Related Work}
DSPy takes inspiration from PyTorch, a powerful deep learning framework developed by researchers like \textcite{Collobert2002}, \textcite{bergstra-proc-scipy-2010} and \textcite{chainer2015} and others. While PyTorch excels at creating deep learning models, DSPy borrows its methodology to specifically tackle the construction of language model pipelines. Instead of focusing on neural network operations, DSPy empowers developers to seamlessly chain and orchestrate language model calls.\\
\\
In the field of foundation model programming, in-context learning is a critical mechanism. A growing body of research \parencite{ouyang2022training}, particularly with instruction tuning, has shown that we can achieve complex behaviors through prompting. This is similar to how weak supervision, which typically requires task-specific interventions \parencite{ratner2017data}, \parencite{hancock2018training}, can now be handled by large language models \parencite{wang2023selfconsistency, zhang2022automatic, shao2023synthetic}.\\
\\
In-context learning methods frequently make use of various tools, resulting in large language model pipelines that incorporate retrieval models, multimodal foundation models, and even more conventional tools such as APIs and calculators \parencite{Lewis2020, izacard2022atlas}. Several toolkits have been developed to simplify this process, including LangChain \parencite{chase22}, Semantic Kernel \parencite{microsoft2023}, LlamaIndex \parencite{llama2022}, and many other retrieval and agent libraries. These toolkits provide pre-built chains and agents that connect large language models with a variety of readily available tools. However, they still have the same problem as prompt engineering, where task-specific behaviors are expressed through manually written prompt templates. These handcrafted prompts can be time-consuming and error-prone and may not to applicable across different language models.\\
\\
Researchers are starting to use discrete optimization and reinforcement learning (RL) to find more effective prompts for large language models (LLMs) \parencite{guo2023connecting, huang2022large, pryzant2023automatic}.  With DSPy, a new framework, we can now automatically generate prompts that are more likely to produce the desired results. DSPy works by first breaking down the desired task into a series of smaller steps. Then, it uses discrete optimization to find the best order for these steps. Finally, it uses RL to fine-tune the prompts for each step.\\
\\
DSPy offers a unique approach to building language model pipelines, breaking down the process into distinct components:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item dspy Signatures: These are the blueprints for your pipeline, defining the desired tasks and goals in a human-readable format. Think of them as the broad strokes of your project, outlining the overall objectives and expected outcomes.
    \item dspy Modules: These are the building blocks that execute specific actions within your pipeline. They can be categorized as:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Retrieval Modules: Access and retrieve relevant information from various sources like databases or text corpora.
        \item LM Modules: Interact with large language models, feeding them inputs and receiving outputs.
        \item Tool Modules: Integrate with external tools and APIs, expanding the capabilities of your pipeline beyond pure language processing.
    \end{itemize}
    \item Teleprompters: These act as the "directors" of your pipeline, orchestrating the execution of modules in the correct order and providing necessary context to each module. They utilize:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Constraints: Specify limitations or guidelines for the pipeline, ensuring it operates within desired boundaries.
        \item Demonstrations: Provide high-quality examples for each stage of the pipeline, guiding the LMs towards the desired outcome.
    \end{itemize}
    \item Optimizers: These are the fine-tuning mechanisms that continuously improve your pipeline's performance. DSPy employs two main strategies:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Model Selection: Evaluates different configurations and selects the one that yields the best results on a validation set.
        \item Reinforcement Learning (RL): Interactively trains the LMs and teleprompters within the pipeline, learning from successes and failures to optimize performance over time.
    \end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}
DSPy empowers to build complex and effective language model pipelines without getting bogged down in technical details. By leveraging these components, researchers can unlock the full potential of LLMs and achieve remarkable results in various tasks and domains.\\

\begin{enumerate}
    \item How do self-improvement mechanisms within DSPy pipelines enhance the user experience in interactive domains?
    \item How can application-specific datasets be leveraged to personalize and optimize DSPy-driven language models?
    \item How does DSPy's compilation and optimization process impact model performance and resource usage?
\end{enumerate}
