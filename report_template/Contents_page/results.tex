\section{Experimental Analysis on GSM8k datset}

The GSM8k dataset stands as a gold standard for evaluating the proficiency of LLMs in solving grade-school math word problems. Comprising 8,500 high-quality, linguistically diverse problems, this dataset encompasses a wide array of mathematical concepts, including arithmetic, fractions, percentages, and basic algebra. The problems are carefully designed to require multi-step reasoning, mirroring the complexity of real-world mathematical challenges.\\
\\
Unlike traditional math datasets that often focus on simple calculations, GSM8k emphasizes the understanding of natural language and the ability to translate word problems into a sequence of mathematical operations. This unique characteristic makes it a particularly challenging yet highly relevant benchmark for assessing the mathematical reasoning abilities of LLMs.\\
\\
The evaluation of LLMs on the GSM8k dataset, facilitated by the DSPy framework, offers a comprehensive understanding of their strengths and weaknesses in this critical domain. By leveraging DSPy's streamlined evaluation pipeline, we were able to conduct a rigorous and reproducible analysis of model performance, uncovering nuanced insights into their mathematical reasoning capabilities.\\

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{DSPy-Powered Evaluation:} By harnessing the capabilities of DSPy, we established a standardized and reproducible evaluation process. This ensured that all models were subjected to the same testing conditions, allowing for a fair and objective comparison of their mathematical prowess.

    \item \textbf{Performance Trends:} DSPy's analysis revealed distinct performance trends. Larger models, exemplified by Meta-Llama-3-70B-Instruct as shown in Figure \ref{bar_1} and \ref{box_1}, consistently outperformed their smaller counterparts. This observation, enabled by DSPy's meticulous data collection and aggregation, reinforces the notion that model scale is a critical factor in mathematical reasoning tasks.
